# Queretaro-ArtSystem-Graph
Raw data and unweighed graph of art exhibitions in Queretaro, Mexico.

This is part of my Master's thesis in Design and Innovation at the Engineering Faculty in UAQ, Mexico.
It is not complete nor will receive more data until June of 2022, when full design and project will be completed.

To visualize the graph as it is configured, you must install Neo4j (https://neo4j.com/download-neo4j-now/) in your computer (is free, create an account). Once you're there, create a new DBMS and open it. Copy and paste the cypher code on the console, or import the CSV file. Neo4j has this amazing viasualization app (BLOOM) that allows you to interact and make more human-like queries (otherwise you must learn Cypher), you have to install it (is the main page, where you create a new DBMS).
